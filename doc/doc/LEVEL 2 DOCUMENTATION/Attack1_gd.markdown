# Attack1.gd

## Overview 

The 'Attack1' script extends 'State' class. This script is designed to handle the "attack" state behavior. 'Attack1.gd' provides functions for transitioning to other states and playing the attack animation. 

## Class Definition 

```gdscript  
extends State  
class_name Attack1  
```
## Methods

**`transition()`**  
This method handles transitioning the entity to the "idle" state when the ray case is not colliding with any other objects.  
It uses the **`raycast`** object to detect collisions  
If there are no collisions detected, this function then calls the **`change_state`** method on the parent node in order to switch the state to "idle."

**`animation()`**  
This method plays the "attack" animation using the **`animator`** object.  
It assumes that the existance of an **`animator`** object with the **`play`** method.  
The method is responsible for triggering the visual representation/animation of the attack.

## Usage 
Attach the 'Attack1.gd' script to a node in the Godot scene that represents an entity or object that is able to attack. Ensure that the dependences necessary are included, such as **`ray_cast`** and **`animator`**, and that these objects are properly set up for the functionality to run correctly.

# Arrhythmia 
Arrhythmia is a horror-themed rhythm game that combines exploration and musical boss fights. After waking up on the top floor of a haunted hospital, you must explore each floor and beat the creatures inside in order to escape. By combining RPG elements and rhythm, Arrhythmia offers a different experience for players than a traditional rhythm game. Each level must be explored to unlock the path to the boss, and boss fights are dodge-based fights where attacks appear on beat to the rhythm of the song.
